To set up properly the discord forum, you should:

- Create a tag that will be used to mark the tickets as closed (only forum moderators should be able to use this tag)
- You should turn on the option `Require people to select tags when posting` in the forum settings.

Commands are available by everyone, so you must set up the permissions of the bot in the discord server.
See https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/10952702911639-Command-Permissions-Lockout for more information.

# Commands

## For students and assistants

### Ticket creation

For students, basic tickets commands are directly triggered by the bot when a new discord post is created.
If practical tag is missing from the ticket, the bot will add it automatically.
Each ticket has an unique id, that is used to identify the ticket.

### /trace

Student can open new trace tickets using /trace command, followed by the tag provided by the assistants.
If the tag is incorrect or user doesn't have the permission to use the specified tag, the bot will send an error
message, listing the available tags.

### Extras

#### /google

Just a troll command that use letmegooglethat.com to search on google.
You'll need a bitly token to use this command, in order to shorten the link.

## For assistants

Assistants can use the following commands to manage the tickets, and trace tickets.

### /close

Inside a ticket thread, assistants can use the /close command to close the ticket.
When closed, thread is locked, so no one can post in it anymore. However, creator of the ticket can reopen it from bot
DM.
There are few optional options to use with this command:

- type:
    - `Resolve` (default): the ticket is marked as resolved
    - `Duplicate`: the ticket is marked as duplicate, and warn the user that he should read the other tickets before
      opening a new one.
    - `Delete`: the ticket is deleted (a copy of all messages is sent to the assistant in the logs channel)
    - `ForceResolve`: the ticket is marked as resolved, but user won't be able to reopen it.
- reason: the reason why the ticket is closed.

### /rename

Inside a ticket thread, assistants can use the /rename command to rename the ticket, instead of going to the thread
settings.
It's also useful because the bot will keep the ticket id in the title.

### /close_all

Close all the tickets of a specific tag.
> Tag parameter must be tag ID.

If not tag is specified, then it lists all the tags ids.

### /close_trace

Inside a trace ticket channel, assistants can use the /close_trace command to close the ticket.
When closed, channel is deleted, so no one can post in it anymore.
All messages are saved in the logs channel.

### /link

Generate a link to the ticket, knowing the ticket id.
Works from any discord channel.
